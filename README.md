## Contributors
- For fetching data, I learn from Udemy (Modern React with Redux [2023 Update]) and Doing research on Google such as [Shecodes](https://www.shecodes.io/) and also [MDN](https://www.shecodes.io/) other random resources.
- For icons, I got recommended from TourLeng in ANBPrime Team,[Meteocons](https://bas.dev/)
- For everything in this weather app, I did and did research about the this weather project by myself and sometimes if I did not clear about some functions in Js that need to use in my concepts of using it to get things display in my components, I sometimes ask ANB prime member about usage of that function.
## App components flow
- I decided to create 5 components such as Location, ShowWeather, Time, TodayWeather, Wrapper to work differently.
- For Wrapper component, I mainly for fetching API and combine other components to render.
- For Location component, I created it for get data from API through props and use it to display city and short name of the country.
- For Time component, I created for showing date and current time and pass it to Wrapper components. 
- For TodayWeather, I created it for display current weather that take props from Wrapper component and get data to display.
- And lastly, I created Showweather to display next four days that display days, celcius, and icons.
